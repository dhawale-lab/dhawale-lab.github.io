I joined the Centre for Neuroscience, IISc as a PhD student in August 2024. Here in the lab, I try to understand how the brain makes decisions when faced with a large number of options, utilising methods from reinforcement learning. I am also interested in how these strategies may be altered in pathological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease.
