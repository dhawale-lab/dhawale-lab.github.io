 I’m a fifth year undergraduate student majoring in Biology at IISc. I’m interested in modelling behaviour and neural activity in the brain during complex decision tasks using reinforcement learning concepts.
 
I’m also interested in the working mechanisms of the limbic system in emotional processing and behaviours. During my Bachelor’s thesis, I worked with Dr. Anna Beyeler to uncover neural population dynamics during anxiety.
