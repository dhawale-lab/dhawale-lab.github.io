I am an Integrated PhD student at IISc and joined the lab in 2025. I received my B.Sc. in Microbiology from Gargi College, University of Delhi. My interest in the neural basis of social behavior was initially sparked by literature. Currently, I am studying cooperation and coordination in rodents with a focus on evolutionarily conserved brain circuits governing social interactions.
