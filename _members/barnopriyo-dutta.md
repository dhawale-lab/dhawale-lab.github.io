 I am a fifth year undergraduate student in the BS-MS program at IISc, majoring in Biology. I am interested in computational and systems neuroscience with a focus on the neural basis of learning. I joined the lab for my Master's project in which I plan to use a simulation-based approach to understand neural mechanisms of reinforcement learning in continuous environments typical of motor learning tasks.
