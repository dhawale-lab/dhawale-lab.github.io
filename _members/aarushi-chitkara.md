I am a Master's thesis student from Ashoka University. I completed my B.Sc. in Life Science and Biochemistry from St. Xavier's College, Mumbai in 2023. 

My research interests revolve around understanding how the brain coordinates complex tasks, such as scoring a football goal, to achieve precise and intentional actions.
