My fascination with how elders forget recent events but remember old childhood ones sparked my interest in learning about the brain. I completed my BS-MS in Biology from IISER Pune, where I worked in a neuroethology lab studying the initiation of learned motor movements in zebra finches. Listening to firing of neurons aligned with specific behaviors was one of my most captivating experiences. I then joined the Dhawale Lab, where Iâ€™m interested the neural correlates of trial-and-error motor learning.
