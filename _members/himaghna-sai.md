I joined the Centre for Neuroscience, IISc as a PhD student in August 2025. I completed my integrated dual degree from IIT (B.H.U.) Varanasi in Biomedical Engineering where I worked on upper limb prostheses. I became interested in neuroscience because of its highly interdisciplinary approach with cool applications. I am currently working on new recording technologies that would allow us to track the same neurons over months to understand how learning alters neural population dynamics. My end goal is to build the Matrix (the Keanu Reeves one, of course), for research purposes.
