I joined the Centre for Neuroscience (CNS) as a Postdoctoral Researcher in 2025. I completed my PhD in Experimental Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee and subsequently held a postdoctoral position at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Prior to joining CNS, my research focused on the role of hippocampal replay during sleep in supporting memory consolidation. Motivated by the close functional interplay between the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in goal-directed learning and decision-making, I joined the Dhawale Lab at CNS to investigate the PFC more deeply. My current work examines how the prefrontal cortex contributes to reinforcement learning and guides animal behaviour in multi-armed bandit tasks.
